#  B.3.3. Aim 1 Data Analysis.

---

- Examine the patterns of change in EI services
    - January 2015 to May 2023
- Evaluate the degree to which change trajectories are moderated by telehealth, child disability, race, ethnicity, and location.
--

- Will use .highlight[LGM] within .highlight[SEM]
- Based on a spline (piecewise) LGM 
--

- A single model can be used to assess both Aim 1a and Aim 1b.

.highlight[What is LGM]?

1. Within-person (*intra*individual) change
    - Track how each person changes *over time*
    - Capture deviations from overall growth (*variability*)
    - Observe individual change patterns

---

```{r out.width = "85%", out.extra='id="zoom-margin"'}
include_graphics("img/person-trajectory.png")
```

1. Within-person (*intra*individual) change
    - Track how each person changes *over time*
    - Capture deviations from overall growth (*variability*)
    - Observe individual change patterns

2. Between-person (*inter*individual) change
    - Get average change patterns over multiple people
    - Explore how people differ in how they change

.highlight[Why use SEM]?

- Avoid limitations, e.g.
    - measurement model
    - parameters serve as predictors
    - model multiple dependent variables    
    - flexibility in the shape of change
--
- Requires data in wide format 

--
- (Can adjust for variations in time of measurement)

- Identify patterns of change
- Examine the impact of predictor variables

--

- .highlight[Moderation] effects provide a more nuanced understanding

#  B.4.4. Aim 2 Data Analysis.

- Examine the patterns of change in CCITSN scores
    - cognitive, social-emotional, communication, fine motor, gross motor
- Investigate EI services and child developmental outcomes, modeling growth processes within and between both variables over time.
- Determine the impact of child disability, race, and ethnicity
--

- Will use .highlight[parallel process LGM] 
--

- A single model can be used to assess both Aim 2a and Aim 2b.
