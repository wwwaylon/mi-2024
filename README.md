# Workshop "Handling Missing Data in Research: A Practical Guide"

[Waylon Howard](https://wwwaylon.github.io/)

## Overview

This session is designed to summarize missing data theory and analysis from an applied research perspective. The first part of the talk is intended to summarize key terms and theory. Then we will discuss techniques for handling missing data. For those interested I have provided examples that demonstrate many fundamental points with an emphasis on general concepts over calculations. All examples are available for download.

## Learning objectives

Upon course completion, we should

1. recognize how theory and modern missing data handling procedures have made it possible for applied researchers to effectively handle missing data.
2. consider using MI/FIML methods rather than traditional approaches (which are often statistical software program defaults). 
3. discussion of myths and misconceptions when using MI/FIML. 

## Audience & Prerequisites

This session is intended for a general research audience, especially those interested in missing data from a basic applied research perspective. The talk assumes some basic understanding of statistics and missing data but is largely self-contained. The talk will reference examples using basic statistical analyses (e.g., regression), for which a familiarity would be useful. However, these analyses are not the focus of this talk.
